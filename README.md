<h1>Lalá Bronze</h1>

Lalá Bronze is a bronze center and wellbeing located in Varzea da Palma, recognized for it's solid presence and engagement with customers through Instagram. Aiming to further improve communication and relationship capabilities with it's customers, I proposed the implementation of a personalized biolink using HTML and CSS.

This project aims to create a more interactive and personalized experience for the workshop's followers, allowing intuitive navigation through relevant information, such as services offered, special events and much more. Through this technological solution, Lalá Bronze seeks to strengthen ties with its online community, providing a unique and efficient digital experience.
